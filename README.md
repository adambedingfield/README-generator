You can choose between four different licenses (Apache, Boost, BSD, and Eclipse) and information pertaining to them will be added into your README. You may also choose to not include extra contact info though it will default to yes if you don't choose.
## Generated README
Once you have answered all the questions your README.md will be created in the dist folder.
An example of a finished README.md is shown below.
